					<h1>Leonardo</h1>
					<p>
						Leonardo, nickname Leo, is a fictional superhero and one of the four
						main characters in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and
						related media. He is often depicted wearing a blue eye mask. His
						signature weapons are two ninjatōs (commonly confused as Katanas).
						Leonardo is the eldest brother and the leader of the group. He is
						the most skilled, the most serious, the most spiritual, the most
						disciplined, and the most in-line with Splinter's teachings and
						thoughts. Like all of the brothers, he is named after a Renaissance
						artist, in this case Leonardo da Vinci. Da Vinci is widely
						considered the most diversely skilled individual of the Renaissance
						period, and as such Leonardo is also considered the most diversely
						skilled ninja turtle.

					<h1>Michelangelo</h1>
					<p>
						Michelangelo (originally Michaelangelo), nickname Mike or Mikey, is
						a fictional superhero and one of the four main characters of the
						Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all related media. He is
						usually depicted wearing an orange eye mask. His signature weapons
						are dual nunchaku, though he has also been portrayed using other
						weapons, such as a grappling hook, manriki-gusari, tonfa, and a
						three-section staff (in some action figures). Michaelangelo is the
						most naturally skilled of his four brothers. But prefers having a
						good time than training. More fun-loving than his brothers and the
						youngest of the group. Michelangelo was given a much bigger role in
						the 1987 cartoon series, directed at a younger audience, than in the
						more serious original comic books which were aimed at an older
						audience. He often coins most of their catchphrases, such as
						"Cowabunga!". Like all of the brothers, he is named after a
						Renaissance artist; in this case, he is named after Michelangelo
						Buonarroti. The spelling of the character's name varies from source
						to source, and he has been alternately shown as both Michelangelo
						and Michaelangelo

						His primary signature weapon are his effective bō staffs. In all
						media, he is the smartest of the four turtles. He is listed as 4' in
						height on the original action figure release. Donnie often speaks in
						technobabble with a natural aptitude for science and technology. For
						this Donnie ninja skills is the lowest of the four turtles. Relying

						Donatello

					<h1>Raphael</h1>
					<p>
						Raphael, nickname Raph, is a fictional superhero and one of the four
						main characters of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all
						related media. He is usually depicted wearing a red eye mask; in
						this regard he is the only turtle to retain the color in all media,
						whereas the others each received a different color. Raphael wields
						twin sai, the points of which are usually sharpened, as his primary
						weapon. Raphael is most famous for his temperamental personality,
						being short-tempered, aggressive, sullen, maddened, and rebellious.
						He is portrayed in most interaction as speaking with a Brooklyn
						accent. The origin of Raphael's anger is not always fully explored,
						but in some incarnations appears to stem partly from the realization
						that they are the only creatures of their kind and ultimately alone.
						He also has a somewhat rival relationship with his older brother
						Leonardo because he is seen as the group's leader. He is the second
						eldest of the turtles, and second-in-command. Raphael gives
						Michelangelo a hard time because of Michelangelo’s natural combat
						ability. Where as Raphael is having to train a lot harder. Like all
						of the brothers, he is named after a Renaissance artist; in this
						case, he is named after the 16th-century Italian painter Raphael. In
						2011, Raphael placed 23rd on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, a list
						that did not feature any of his brothers.
